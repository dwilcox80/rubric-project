Mockup of Rubric Project
As part of our Grow with Google Udacity course, we were asked to take a simple mockup and code it in HTML.
Any suggestions on how this project could have been done differently are appreciated.

My code is labeled as "index.html".

A sample of the mockup is labeled "blog-mockup".

Thanks again!
